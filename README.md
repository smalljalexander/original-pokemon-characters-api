# How to use



# How it’s made 
<b>Tech used:</b> JavaScript and Node.js
I used JavaScript to create a backend api that contains properties and values.  That API uses cors dependency so other engineers can update or change the api on their local machine build. 

# Optimizations
I would want to add pictures of all of the character in the api to expand the api. 
Update the html for instructions on how to use the API

# Lessons Learned
I learned how to make a backend api using JavaScript. I learned how to use heroku to host my API.
